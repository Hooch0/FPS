# FPS Prototype
A FPS project with the goal of a easy to use recoil system with a bullet pattern editor.

# Recoil System
The recoil system is similar to Rainbow Six: Siege's current recoil system. This system major benfit is not constraining the user to a max recoil amount but instead using the pre difined mouse looking constraints as the max the recoil can reach.

# Recoil Pattern
The recoil pattern currently is added to each weapon individually but will later support breaking up patters into scriptable object assets for easy switching between weapons and maintaining a sense of familarity between weapons recoil patterns.

# Recoil Editor
--Note: Not finished yet--
The recoil editor allows the creation of recoil patterns with a easy to use and viusal graph. Each nodes can be selected an assigned to a group to be exported into a predefined pattern for future use. Nodes can be moved around, deleted or unassigned with the current recoil path.
